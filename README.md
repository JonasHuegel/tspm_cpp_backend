# transitive Sequential Pattern Mining Plus (tSPM+) Algorithm
This repository contains the source code for the C++ tSPM+ library implementation, which includes and extends the basic tSPM implementation. It can be used to mine temporal sequences of clinical records given the input data is numric and adherent to the MLHO format. For a More detailed description of the MLHO format, and description for use cases see the vignettes from the correspoinding R-package (https://github.com/JonasHuegel/tSPMPlus_R) 

# How 2 Integrate
Clone/Copy this library into your project and import the tSPM+ header. For an example call, see the file in the example folder or the integration in the C++ code from the corresponding R-Package.


## Requirements
This library requires C++17, openMP and the oneTBB librray installed and linked to be compiled.

## How to Reference
